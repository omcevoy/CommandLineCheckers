# README.md
My group decided to create a command line checkers game for our final project in our CIS 330 class. If you would like to try it, you can play it by cloning the repository. 

Once it has been cloned, generate the executable by entering...

    1 - cmake CMakeLists.txt
    
    2 - make
    
    3 - ./Checkers
    
Hope you enjoy!
